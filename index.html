                  <p class="summary">With a background in sales and big data analysis, I've always been passionate about communicating information through good design, whether by making sales material to present to clients or creating data visualization dashboards for clients. After having worked at an e-commerce tech giant in Japan for 3 years and at a market research tech company in Silicon Valley, I took a leap of faith into a career in web development. I started off making simple websites on my own, and from there started building full-stack applications through the web development immersive program at General Assembly.</p>

                  <p>In every web development project, I spend a good amount of time writing user stories, sketching the wireframe, and modeling the entities of my app. I believe that, without thoughtful planning initially, you cannot build an app that users will find useful.</p>
