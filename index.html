                <h3 class="about-header">About</h3>

                <p class="summary">I am an aspiring web developer with a background in sales and big data analysis. Whether it's making sales material to present to clients or creating data dashboards for company stakeholders and clients, I've always been passionate about visually communicating information through good design. After having worked at an e-commerce tech giant in Japan for 3 years and at a market research tech company in Silicon Valley, I was inspired to switch to a career in web development. I started off building simple websites on my own, and from there started a course in web development at General Assembly to transition into this new career path.</p>
